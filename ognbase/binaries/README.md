# Release notes

### Note

Besides the binary here, download the files in the "data" folder: config.json (template), index.html, style.css.


## revision MB140

### Major improvements

Corrected the processing of some data fields that were not being passed correctly in the 2-station mode

### Minor improvements

* Report to OGN the SNR (and BEC) of the original signal received by the remote station
* Removed the "ignore no-track" setting - no-track is never reported, stealth is always reported


## revision MB140

### Major improvements

* Support the LilyGo T3S3 board
* Re-organize time-relay to be symmetric in both directions
 
### Minor improvements

Report remote station stats even when it is not sending time to base station


## revision MB139

### Minor improvements

Measure radio noise level and use it for calculating SNR and to collect noise statistics


## revision MB138

### Major improvements
* Fixed bugs that prevented decryption of FLARM packets in Europe
* Fixed: no charging of the battery in T-Beam v1.2


## revision MB137

* Turn GNSS module off if not needed.
* Improved handling of packets air-relayed by SoftRF.
* Can set a custom private port for (remotely) accessing the web interface.
